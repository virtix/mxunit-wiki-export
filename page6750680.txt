h1. Session Description

Perhaps you have some unit tests. Maybe even an ANT build file that runs your tests.
And maybe even a build file that packages or deploys your application. But how do
you orchestrate those separate pieces into a symphony of automation? Continuous Integration,
of course.

Imagine: you have tests. A Teammate commits code to source control. Minutes later,
you and your teammate get an email indicating that tests are now failing.

Imagine: you commit code. Minutes later, all tests run. All tests pass. Zip files
are built and are ready for deployment. Or code was automatically pushed to any accessible
environment. All without your intervention.

In this session, I'll demonstrate how to use the open source Jenkins Continuous Integration
server, together with ANT and MXUnit, to create a top-notch automated test and build
system for your ColdFusion applications.
