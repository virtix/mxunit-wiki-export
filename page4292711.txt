Why MXUnit?

h2. Why MXUnit?

Several fine unit testing frameworks exist for ColdFusion. Why choose MXUnit?

At its core, MXUnit grew around the concept of making things easier for the person
writing the tests. We believe people shy away from unit testing because the perception
(sometimes justified\!) is that it's too inconvenient. We sought to change that.

h3. Convenience features

* [Easy to see your data|http://mxunit.org/doc/index.cfm?doc=viewdebugoutput] with
cfoutput, cfdump, and debug()
* Easy to [see your cfcatch|http://mxunit.org/doc/index.cfm?doc=viewdebugoutput#cfcatch]
struct when errors occur
* Test [single methods|http://mxunit.org/doc/index.cfm?doc=runsinglemethod] inside
a test case
* Easy "[directory runner|http://mxunit.org/doc/index.cfm?doc=directorytests]" for
running entire directories of tests
* Easy to [test private functions|http://mxunit.org/doc/index.cfm?doc=testprivate]
in your components
* Ability to [switch to message-first style assertions|http://mxunit.org/doc/index.cfm?doc=messagefirstassertions]
to help ease transition from other frameworks

In addition to convenience features, MXUnit contains all the essential components
of any unit testing framework:

h3. Framework Must-Haves

Test Generator for existing components

[Eclipse Plugin|http://mxunit.org/doc/index.cfm?doc=installplugin] with built-in help
and [keyboard shortcuts|http://mxunit.org/doc/index.cfm?doc=pluginshortcuts]

Ant Integration

Plugin architecture for creating custom assertions

Many different [output formats|http://mxunit.org/doc/index.cfm?doc=outputformats]
* Basic HTML results
* ExtJS "fancy" grid results
* XML results
* JUnitReport XML results (for use with the ANT task and the JUnitReport Ant Task)
* Query results

h3. Active Development

* We're actively developing MXUnit and have more convenience features in the works.
A sample:
* Easier exception testing
* Easier auto-rollback for tests that access databases
* JUnit 4 style "Hamcrest" assertions (assertThat(....))
* Customizable test generation
