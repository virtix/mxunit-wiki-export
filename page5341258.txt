Wildcard Pattern Matching

5374015


A lot of times, especially while creating stubs, you will just want to mimic some
desired behavior and not be concerned about about what parameters are being passed
to the mock. This is easily accomplished by using wildcard patterns. Example:

{*} is 0 or more parameters of any type and {+} is one or more parameters of any type.

{code}&lt;cfset myMock.doSomething ('{*}').returns(myQuery) /&gt;{code}


This says that any call made to doSomething that has zero or more parameters will
return myQuery. Likewise,

{code}&lt;cfset myMock.doSomething ('{+}').returns(myQuery) /&gt;{code}

Says that any call made to doSomething with one or more parameters will return myQuery.

It's important to note that the distinction of this call:

{code}&lt;cfset myMock.doSomething () /&gt;{code}

This means that doSomthing() expects exactly 0 parameters.
