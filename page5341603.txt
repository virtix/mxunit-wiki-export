How to use it

In general the steps will follow this simple pattern:
# Create the mock
# Define behavior
# Inject the mock into the component under test
# Run the component under test
# Optionally verify how the mock was called

There's a subtle yet important difference between mocking and stubbing. Stubbing typically
involves faking what _data_ is returned by an object, while mocking is faking the
_behavior_. See the next pages for examples.
