MXUnit now offers a built-in, simple, lightweight framework for mocking component
interactions; this is also known as _MightyMock_. It provides you the ability to easily
and quickly define behaviors for dependencies, including both mocking and stubbing.
When mocking, selective verification is possible, and when stubbing you can define
return data or throw exceptions.

One slick feature is the ability to match invocations by argument pattern. This gives
you the flexibility to specify either literal arguments or patterns in your mock.
More on this in the [Argument Matching] section.

*Prefer or already use another mocking framework like MockBox?* No problem\! When
using MXUnit's mocking syntax, you can [tell it to use the mocking framework of your
choice|Using External Mocking Frameworks].
