Creating a Mock

5374300
MXUnit's mocking integration allows you to create a mock with a single method call
from within your test case, using the _mock()_ method.

The fastest way to create a mock is to call mock() with no arguments:
{code:title=Simple Mock Example}
&lt;cfset mockOtherComponent = mock() /&gt;
{code}

If the component under test (CUT) expects the object that you are mocking to be of
a specific type, you can create a _typeSafe_ mock:
{code:title=typeSafe Mock Example}
&lt;cfset mockOtherComponent = mock("my.component.toBeMocked","typeSafe") /&gt;
{code}

That code will generate a mock that ColdFusion will recognize as being an instance
of _my.component.toBeMocked_. Note that if the framework cannot create an instance
of that object an exception will be thrown.

Once you've created a mock you'll want to [define the behaviour|Defining a Mock's
