Testing MXUnit

4980749
When making changes to the MXUnit framework it's a good idea to test those changes
to ensure you haven't broken anything. Luckily MXUnit can be used to test itself!
Methods of running MXUnit's tests include:
# via the Eclipse plugin
# via the browser
# via the ant task

h3. Running the Unit Tests via the Eclipse Plugin

In the _Navigator_ tab, simply point to the _/tests_ folder, off of the MXUnit root,
right-click, and choose *_Run MXUnit Tests_*. You should see the results of the tests
in the MXUnit tab.

h3. Expected Errors and Failures

*Fixtures Can Be Safely Ignored*

When running all of the tests in the /tests folder, some errors and failures will
be reported. Most of these are due to fixtures being run as tests, so you can safely
ignore any errors or failures reported from test cases that reside in a folder with
the word _fixture_ in its name.

*Expected Failures*
* testAdd2() in mxunit.tests.samples.MyComponentTest fails with an mxunit.exception.AssertionFailedError
failure. It can be safely ignored.
* mismatchedArgumentTypesShouldFail() in mxunit.tests.mightymock.ArgumentMatcherTest
fails because it is a placeholder for unimplemented logic.
* attemptingToRegisterTheSamePatternShouldThrowMeaningfulException() in mxunit.tests.mightymock.InvocationTestArgumentMatcherTest
fails as a reminder to fix or document an issue.
* testWriteLog() in mxunit.tests.mightymock.MockLoggerTest fails because it is a placeholder
for unimplemented logic.
* $addInvocationRecordForBothPatternAndLiteral() in mxunit.tests.mightymock.MockRegistryTest
fails because it is a placeholder for unimplemented logic.
* howToHandlePatternVerification() in mxunit.tests.mightymock.MockVerificationTest
fails because it is a placeholder for unimplemented logic.
* $verifyExact() in mxunit.tests.mightymock.OrderTest fails because it is a placeholder
for unimplemented logic.
* shouldBeAbleToVerifyBothePatternAndLiteral() in mxunit.tests.mightymock.PatternInvocationTest
fails because it is a placeholder for unimplemented logic.
