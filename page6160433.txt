Launching your ColdFusion AMI as a new Instance

h1. Launching your instance

Previously, you created an AMI based on the ColdFusion server you built. After a while,
that AMI will be available for you, from which you can launch multiple new instances.
# From the AWS Console, select the Amazon EC2 Tab, then select "AMIs"
# Select the AMI you created. If you don't see it, select "Owned by me" in the "Viewing"
dropdown to show you just the AMIs you've created
# Right click, and hit "Launch Instance".

This will take you through the same set of screens you encountered when you created
your first ColdFusion instance. The only difference here is that you're launching
an instance of a machine that you configured. Go through all the same steps with Security
Groups and Key Pairs, and launch that sucker. You can choose to use the Key Pair and
Security Group that you already created.
