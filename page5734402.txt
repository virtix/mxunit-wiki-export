Adding MXUnit Snippets To CFEclipse

5767170
[CFEclipse|http://cfeclipse.org] gives you the same snippet functionality you know
and love from ColdFusion Studio. And now it goes a step further: SnipEx servers. This
means you can get snippets from other folks simply by pointing to a snipex URL.
MXUnit uses the CFSnippets.org snipex server created by Todd Sharp.


This set of instructions assumes you know how to use snippets in CFEclipse (it does
not assume you know how to use snipex). Please read about snippets first if you don't
know what they are. If you're interested in learning more about snipex, please read
that, too. It's quick and short and good.

*Step 1: Clear your snippet cache*
NOTE: you can skip this step if you've never set up the cfsnippets.org snipex server
(From Ray Camden's blog post)
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 1. Change to your Eclipse workspace. Mine was at /Users/ray/Documents/workspace
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2. Change to .metadata/.plugins/org.cfeclipse.cfml/snipex
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 3. Delete all XML files
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 4. Restart Eclipse

*Step 2: Add the cfsnippets.org snipex server*

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 1. Open the Snip Tree View
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2. Click the little white upside down triangle to the far right
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 3. Select "Edit SnipEx Servers"
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 4. Add [http://cfsnippets.org/model/snippets/snipEx/snipEx.cfc] into
the first open URL box
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 5. Click Apply
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 6. Restart Eclipse

*Step 3: Try it out*
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 1. Open any existing test case or create a new one. Or just pop open
the scribble pad.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2. Open the snip tree view
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 3. You'll now see "CFSnippets.org" as a new entry in the tree
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 4. Expand the tree. Look in the tree for "MXUnit". Expand it.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 5. You'll see all available snippets for MXUnit in there.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 6. To insert a snippet, just double click it\!
