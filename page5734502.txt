How cfcomponent output="true"  can affect memory consumption

h2. Introduction

Bob Silverberg and I were trying to tackle a memory problem in his unit tests for
ValidateThis. Running CF with 1GB of memory, he'd get Out Of Memory Errors and his
tests would not complete when run in the browser \-\- i.e. all tests running in a
single page request. When run through Eclipse \-\- where each test method is run as
a separate request \-\- he had no troubles.

This is our story.

h2. First Line of Defense

I always suggest these as the first culprits in memory problems:
# Memory Tracking turned on in the CF Server Monitor
# Request output debugging turned on in CFAdmin (I'm NOT talking about the Line Debugger...
just regular old debug output)

In and of themselves neither of these are evil; however, when an application, or a
particular page, does a tremendous amount of work, both of those can become problems
in a hurry.

Bob turned both off, and he was still running out of memory.

h2. My first task...

I needed to replicate the issue. I got all his code and ran his tests. Fortunately,
I, too, received an OOME. I then turned off debugging and, sure enough, the tests
completed as expected (though slowly).

So, lesson #1 kids: debugging can crash your server

{tip}At this point, I no longer have problems, but Bob still does. Thus, we're not
done yet{tip}

h2. Meanwhile, Back at Bob's Ranch

I suggested to Bob that he start to troubleshoot this by adding the "excludes" attribute
onto his DirectoryTestSuite, and initially exclude everything but the first test,
then incrementally remove tests from the Excludes until he got the error. Then, he'd
probably know which test was causing troubles.&amp;nbsp;

Normally, this is a fine approach. It turns out that it wouldn't have helped anyway.
But hey, this stuff is hit and miss.

h2. Gathering data

My next step was to get a heap dump of ColdFusion as it was running the tests... I
needed to see what was consuming all the memory. To do so, I used the java "jmap"
command to get the dump and Eclipse MAT to analyze the dump. This is not nearly as
complicated as it sounds, and I wrote up [full instructions here|http://blog.mxunit.org/2010/01/using-eclipse-mat-to-track-down.html]
.

h2. Inspecting data

I used Eclipse MAT to inspect the heap dump. When I first loaded it, I opened the
"Dominator Tree" and saw the following two entries sucking up a combined 200+MB of
RAM:
* coldfusion.filter.FusionContext
* coldfusion.bootstrat.BoostrapClassLoader

Let's look at the first few consumers for each of these: !memory1.png|align=center!
Now, looking at the BootstrapClassLoader, I see a FontSetBuilder taking up a whole
lot of memory. I have no idea what the hell that is, so I ignore it. I figure I can't
do anything about it anyway, so....

Let's look at the big old HashMap in the FusionContext. That looks like something
I might be able to do something about. Why? Well, I don't know... I just imagine that
any variables my app is creating live in there.
