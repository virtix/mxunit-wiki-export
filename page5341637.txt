Debugging Mocks

5374338
In most non-trivial apps, it's important to know what's going on under the hood. This
is particularly true for mocks. If something doesn't seem right you can inspect a
mock to see how it's been defined and how it's been invoked. This is accomplished
by using the &amp;nbsp;(debugMock()) method. This returns a _raw_ struct with all the
information about the mock object:

{code:title="Mock Debug"}
//Some MXUnit test case

//create
myMock = mock();

//define behavior
myMock.foo().returns(1234);

//invoke
myMock.foo();

//inspect
debug( myMock.debugMock() );

{code}
