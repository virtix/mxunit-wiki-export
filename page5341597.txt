Creating a Mock

5374298
MXUnit's mocking integration allows you to create a mock with a single method call
from within your test case, using the _mock()_ method.

The fastest way to create a mock is to call mock() with no arguments:
{code:title=Simple Mock Example}
&lt;cfset mockOtherComponent = mock() /&gt;
{code}

If the component under test (CUT) expects the object that you are mocking to be of
a specific type, you can create a _type-safe_ mock:
{code:title=typeSafe Mock Example}
&lt;cfset mockOtherComponent = mock('my.component.toBeMocked','typeSafe') /&gt;
{code}

That code will generate a mock that ColdFusion will recognize as being an instance
of _my.component.toBeMocked_. Note that if the framework cannot create an instance
of that object an exception will be thrown.

If you already have an instance of an object, and want to turn it into a mock, you
can simply pass the instance of the object into the mock() method, which will create
a type-safe mock:
{code:title=typeSafe Mock from a Component Example}
&lt;cfset otherComponent = createObject('component','my.component.toBeMocked') /&gt;
&lt;cfset mockOtherComponent = mock(otherComponent) /&gt;
{code}

If you wish to create a mock using a framework other than MXUnit's built-in mocking
framework, you can pass a third argument to the mock() method, specifying the framework's
name:
{code:title=Mocking with a Different Framework}
&lt;cfset mockOtherComponent = mock('my.component.toBeMocked','','MockBox') /&gt;
{code}

That will generate a mock using the MockBox framework. Currently MockBox and ColdMock
are supported as external mocking frameworks, but others can be plugged in by editing
the mxunit-config.xml file in the framework folder.

For more information on using external mocking frameworks with MXUnit, including how
to specify a global mocking framework (instead of having to pass the framework name
into the mock() call), see the [Using External Mocking Frameworks] section.

Once you've created a mock you'll want to [define the behaviour|Defining a Mock's
Behaviour] of the mock.
