{toc:minLevel=4}
I have tried to anticipate the most common problems and address them in the Help that
comes with the MXUnit Eclipse plugin. You should always consult the Help first\!

h4. Q: What version of Eclipse will the plugin work in?

A: As of right now, Eclipse 3.4 and later. If you need a version that works on Eclipse
3.3, use [http://mxunit.org/update33] as the update site


h4. Q: Why won't the plugin see "MyFile.cfc" as a test?

A: Because the file doesn't start or end with the word "Test".

h4. Q: The plugin seems to be ignoring my custom RemoteFacade.cfc URL

A: Try restarting Eclipse. Also, it only honors that URL when it's set at the project
level, not in a subdirectory of a project

h4. Q: The plugin can't figure out my "cfc path" (dot notation)

A: Read the plugin help. If you still can't figure it out from reading the help, please
email the [Google Group|http://groups.google.com/group/mxunit]

h4. Q: The plugin won't do anything with a TestSuite I created

A: The plugin doesn't do test suites. Read the Help for an explanation

h4. Q: Why doesn't the plugin support NTLMv2?

A: Because neither Apache Axis nor commons HTTPClient doesn't support it. There does
not, as of this writing, appear to be a free java client for NTLMv2

h4. Q: What are the differences between how the plugin runs tests and how the tests
run when I run them in the browser?

A: The plugin runs test test one test at a time, one request at a time. This means
there is zero chance for "bleed" from one test method run to another. When you run
them in the browser, they're run as a single request.

In addition, since the plugin runs the tests via SOAP, the FORM scope is not available.

h4. Q: What do you call a snail in a ship?

A: A Snailor\!

h4. Q: Does the Plugin work in ColdFusion Builder?

A: Of course
