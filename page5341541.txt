Here are some references that Los Hombres have found useful:

[Introduction to Software Testing|http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521880386?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mx06-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0521880386]
by Paul Ammann and Jeff Offutt from George Mason University, Fairfax, VA. 

Don't let the title fool you. This is far from an introduction and addresses many
areas of software testing. Specifically, it presents 36 _coverge criteria_ used in
both manual and automated testing. This text represents many years of research in
the area and is a great formal and practical overview of the many challenges associated
with software testing. Note that the authors do not take *any* of the book's royalties;
instead, the royalties are used in a scholarship fund for software engineering students.
If for no other reason, that may be a good motivation to buy the book!
