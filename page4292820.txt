* You can right click on any directory, select "Run MXUnit Tests", and it'll find
your Test components and run them, ignoring all the others
* If you have your test case open in an Eclipse editor, you can right click in the
file, select "Run MXUnit Test", and run the tests in the plugin
* You can find "slow" tests easily by setting the Timeout preference to "1". You can
easily change the timeout preference from the little white triangle on the right side
of the view
* If you maximize the plugin view, the view will automatically put the "Tag Context"
view on the right (i.e. it'll shift from vertical to horizontal)
* [debug()|default:View Debug Output] and the "b" keyboard shortcut are perhaps your
best friends
* If you need to copy the contents of a failure or error message, you can select the&amp;nbsp;
failed/errored test in the tree, then select a row in the TagContext panel, right
click, and choose "Copy Exception" or "Copy Tag Context"
