h1. Communicating Build Results


All of the information Jenkins provides is lovely; however, we're not interested in
monitoring the Hudson interface every time a build runs. Instead, we want to get 
notified when things change. That's it: *when build status  changes*. For me, continuous
integration is as much about communicating  results as it is about providing an easy,
scheduled mechanism for running your  tests (we don't care about compiling and linking
in CF applications, so that  core benefit of CI doesn't apply to us either).

Ideally, only interested parties would be notified on a change in build  status. For
example, let's say a build runs at 8:00 AM, and all tests pass. It  runs again at
8:15 AM, and tests fail. What I want to happen is:
# Hudson looks at source control for the users who have committed code since  the
last build
# Hudson notifies \*just\* those people that the build is now failing.
# Hudson does this either via email, instant message (SMS), or both.

Fortunately, this is all possible. Let's set it up.

h1. Configuring Email Settings

From the main Hudson screen, type "configure" in the search box

Scroll down to the bottom and find the E-mail notification section.

I'm using gmail in this case, so I plugged in my gmail credentials, using  "smtp.gmail.com"
as the server. I'm keeping "default email suffix" blank since  this can't be computed
(this would be more for corporate email accounts where  you can trust that the email
would end up as "firstname" + "lastname" + default  email suffix, for example).

In the Advanced settings, I checked "use smtp authentication", entered my  email address
into the username field, added my password, checked "use ssl", and  specified the
port as 465

h1. Configuring SMS (Jabber) via GTalk

From the "manage Hudson" screen, click on Manage Plugins

go to "Available Plugins", and find the "Hudson Jabber notifier plugin".  Click things
and install it. Restart if necessary.

Now, back in your Manage Hudson screen, you'll have a new section, right  above the
Email section, for Jabber.

I entered my gmail address and password, and "talk.google.com" as the server.  That's
it\!

h1. Noise Control

At the project level, you can also configure how noisy you want this  communication
to be. Here's what that looks like: !hudson_notificationconfig[3].png|thumbnail!

From that image, you'll see that I can configure *when* *I want to be notified*...
every build, just on change, etc. Thus,  to substantially reduce the noise from your
scheduled builds, go into the  project and configure it to only notify via IM on status
change. *This,  in my humble opinion, is gold.*

h1. Configuring Users

Now that the communication mechanisms are set up, we have to associate email  addresses
with the subversion users. Quite possibly there's an easier way to do  this via some
batch process, but as I'm just getting started with my Hudson  investigation, I haven't
looked into it. So please don't take this as "the only  way" or "best practice", because
I do not know that to be true.

For my setup for MXUnit, I linked it to SVN and when it updated and there  were changes,
it created new a new user for any user that was associated with a  change. So, I committed
some code to MXUnit, ran a Hudson build, and Hudson  added me as a user, silently.

To give the "marc.esher" user notification details:
# from the main Hudson screen I clicked on "people" then on "marc.esher". (You  can
also get here if you know the username you want to configure by typing that  username
in the "Search" box at the top of the screen)
# click Configure
# enter my email address
# since I installed the Jabber plugin, it also has a space for jabber  credentials.
I entered my gmail address again.

h1. So what's all this get me?

After this configuration was finished, here's what I get:

Emails on build failure that look like this: !hudsonbuildfailure_email[3].png|thumbnail!

GTalk notifications on build failure that look like this: !hudsonbuildfailure_gtalk[2].png|thumbnail!

And corresponding messages for when things go back to normal.

Importantly, *what I don't get*: noise. I don't get notified  on every build via email.
I don't have to constantly go to a website to check  the build status. I get notifications
when I care about them: when things go  bad, and when things go from bad back to good.

h1. Summary

Continuous Integration is about communication. It's about noise control. And  so far
I'm discovering that Hudson is performing admirably. You can configure  different
methods of communication, all hooked into source control, with  different "strategies"
(on every build, on every change, etc). I appreciate this  level of configurability.
In addition, I was able to get all of this going  without reading a single page of
documentation. I think that speaks to Hudson's  ease of use.
