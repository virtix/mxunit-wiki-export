h1. Project-Specific RemoteFacade URL

Pointing a project at a custom RemoteFacade URL involves two simple  steps:
# Create the new RemoteFacade.cfc
# Point your project properties to the new URL

h2. How


h3. Creating the new RemoteFacade.cfc

# Create a New CFC. Put it wherever. Name it whatever.
# Set the "extends" attribute of the component tag to  "mxunit.Framework.RemoteFacade"
# Ensure you can access the wsdl for the file in a browser. For example, if  you created
c:\inetpub\wwwroot\myproject\RemoteFacade.cfc, try hitting [http://localhost/myproject/RemoteFacade.cfc?wsdl]

h3. Pointing your project properties to the new URL

# Right click on the project name in the Navigator or Project Explorer
# Select "Properties"
# Select "MXUnit Properties"
# Add the path to your custom remote URL
#* NOTE: if you're just using this to point to an mxunit install on a different  port,
then you can skip the "/mxunit/framework/RemoteFacade.cfc" part of the  URL. Just
use [http://localhost:8888], for example. In that case, the plugin will  suffix your
url with "mxunit/framework/RemoteFacade.cfc"

h2. Example #1: Creating a custom RemoteFacade.cfc for your project which tests  CF
ORM / Hibernate Components

In your project, create a file named RemoteFacade.cfc and give it this  content:


{code}
&lt;cfcomponent extends="mxunit.framework.RemoteFacade"&gt;
&lt;/cfcomponent&gt;

{code}

Right click on your project and set the RemoteFacade URL property to point to  the
URL for this new component

Now, all calls to your tests *for this project* will route  through this RemoteFacade.cfc.
Since your project also has an Application.cfc,  that means that everything from your
Application.cfc will apply

h2. Example #2: Creating a custom RemoteFacade.cfc for your project and  including
custom behavior for every test case

Follow the same steps as above

In your new RemoteFacade.cfc, implement the actOnTestCase method to peform  whatever
behavior you would like for each test case. Here's an example:

{code}
&lt;cfcomponent extends="mxunit.framework.RemoteFacade"&gt;

	&lt;cffunction name="actOnTestCase"&gt;
		&lt;cfargument name="TestCase"&gt;

		&lt;cfif findNoCase("TestManager.Retail",GetMetadata(TestCase).name)&gt;
			&lt;cfinclude template="retail/Application.cfm"&gt;
		&lt;cfelse&gt;
			&lt;cfinclude template="enrollment/Application.cfm"&gt;
		&lt;/cfif&gt;
	&lt;/cffunction&gt;


&lt;/cfcomponent&gt;


{code}
