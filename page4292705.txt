MXUnit Documentation

This is the home of the MXUnit Public Wiki space.


The idea, maybe, is that this would be the public home for tech docs, blogs, musings,
"the book", etc. Maybe use feedburner to publish the various parts ... content taxonomies?

mxunit.org may still be the landing point, maybe make static html pages for blog,
wiki, support, etc. This would allow for google webmaster tools to create a site map.
