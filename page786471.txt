Why MXUnit?

h2. What is MXUnit?

MXUnit is a unit testing framework for CFML developers, modeled after other xUnit
frameworks (JUnit, etc). MXUnit honors the major XUnit conventions but deviates and
enhances to provide a more enjoyable, idiomatic CF test experience.


h2. Why MXUnit?

Several fine unit testing frameworks exist for ColdFusion. Why choose MXUnit?

At its core, MXUnit grew around the concept of making things easier for the person
writing the tests. We believe people shy away from unit testing because the perception
(sometimes justified\!) is that it's too inconvenient. We sought to change that.

h3. Convenience features

* [Easy to see your data|View Debug Output] with cfoutput, cfdump, and debug()
* Easy to [see your cfcatch|View Debug Output#cfcatch] struct when errors occur
* Test [single methods|Running single test methods] inside a test case
* Easy "[directory runner|Running directories of tests]" for running entire directories
of tests
* Easy to [test private functions|Test Private Methods] in your components
* Ability to [switch to message-first style assertions|Message First Assertions] to
help ease transition from other frameworks

In addition to convenience features, MXUnit contains all the essential components
of any unit testing framework:

h3. Framework Must-Haves

Test Generator for existing components

[Eclipse Plugin|Install the Eclipse Plugin] with built-in help and [keyboard shortcuts|Eclipse
Plugin Keyboard Shortcuts]

Ant Integration

Plugin architecture for creating custom assertions

Many different [output formats|TestResult Output Formats]

* Basic HTML results
* ExtJS "fancy" grid results
* XML results
* JUnitReport XML results (for use with the ANT task and the JUnitReport Ant Task)
* Query results

h3. Active Development

* We're actively developing MXUnit and have more convenience features in the works.
A sample:
* Easier exception testing
* Easier auto-rollback for tests that access databases
* JUnit 4 style "Hamcrest" assertions (assertThat(....))
* Customizable test generation
