h1. Introduction


In an earlier post, I wrote about configuring notifications with Jenkins. This  is
a follow-up post to demonstrate how to set up even more fine-grained  notification
control using the Jenkins [Email Extension Plugin|http://wiki.Jenkins-ci.org//display/Jenkins/Email-ext+plugin].

In a nutshell, this provides granular control over:
* Who receives notifications at any event: build instability, build failure,  return
to stability, continuing failure, etc.
* The subject of the notifications that are sent
* The content of notifications that are sent

By default, as of this writing, Jenkins's email notifications are fairly  basic. It
will notify either a specified list of recipients or "culprits" when a  build fails.
It will contain a generic subject and message, basically indicating  that a build
failed, but with no details.

h2. The Email Extension Plugin: What it gets you

The Email Extension Plugin will enable you to control the content of the  subject
and message to make them more meaningful, in addition to the more  granular controls
I mentioned above.

Here's what your "Configure Project" screen will look like once you install  the plugin:

Notice from this screenshot how you can add notifications on different  triggers:
"Unstable", "Still Failing", etc. You can specify who should receive  messages for
all of the available events. You can add a new event by selecting  one of the available
options in the "Add a trigger" Select list.

Once you do so, you get checkboxes for the recipients to select. In addition,  you
get fields for controlling the subject and message. You can specify all  manner of
variables in there. My current setup at work for message content  is:

$PROJECT_DEFAULT_CONTENT

$FAILED_TESTS

$CHANGES

With these variables, on the events I have specified, I get to see what tests  have
failed and what code changes have happened since the last build. Other  variables
are available to you. As per Jenkins's conventions, simply click on the  \(?) icon
beside the configuration to get all the details for how to use the  plugin. Here's
a sample of what you currently get in the Help: !hudson_editablenotification_help.png|thumbnail!

h1. My Take

I wrote before about how Jenkins can significantly aide in noise control. I  think
this plugin gets you even further. Consider the "default case": you get a  notification
that a build failed. Now you have to go research why it failed.  This means going
to your Jenkins URL, checking the failed tests, and determining  responsibility. However,
with the plugin, I believe determining responsibility  cuts out a few steps: it lets
you see a) what tests failed and b) what code  changed in a single email. All the
information you and your team need to assign  responsibility is, potentially, in a
single communication.

*So what?* I think the answer to that question resides  squarely in the answer to
another question: *how much do you value your  time?*

h1. How to Install

You install this plugin just like you install other Jenkins plugins, thank God  (I
Love Jenkins. I wish all software I worked with were as easy to extend.)
# click the Jenkins link, "Manage Jenkins", "Manage Plugins"
# in the "available" tab, select "Jenkins Email Extension Plugin"
# select it, and click checkboxes and OK buttons until it's installed. Restart  Jenkins

Once it's installed, you go into your project configuration and now you have  more
"Advanced" buttons and such in the Notifications area than you had before.  From there,
it's a matter of selecting your triggers and what you want to happen  on those triggers.

h1. Conclusion

If you want even more noise control, and more meaningful communication, take  the
few minutes to install the Jenkins Email Extension Plugin.
