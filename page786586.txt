h2. *MXUnit TestResult output formats*

MXUnit provides a high level of flexibility by providing    test results in various
output formats. Some of these are   preformatted, such as HTML, and others are _raw_
to   allow developers to generate customizable output formats.

The available TestResult output formats are:
# HTML Format
# ExtJs Format
# XML Format
# JUnit Report XML
# ColdFusion Query Format
# ColdFusion Array format
We will use the MXUnit example found in  the installation package mxunit/samples/MyTestSuite.cfm
as the   base TestResults.    You may want to refer to your local TestResult API for
details; e.g., http://localhost:8500/mxunit/doc/api/

The syntax for generating the various types of output is:
