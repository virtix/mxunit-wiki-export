Eclipse Plugin Troubleshooting

4325559
In general, problems with the plugin come in two varieties:
* The plugin can't figure out the correct "cfc path" for a file
* The plugin can't communicate with the RemoteFacade URL

h2. CFC Path

If you've read the Help documentation in the plugin and you still can't figure out
how to get the plugin to correctly derive the CFC path for your components, then please
follow these steps:
# Close Eclipse
# Open eclipse.ini in the eclipse install directory, and add "-debug" on a separate
line, toward the top of the file. For example, it might look like this:
# {code}-startup
plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.0.200.v20090520.jar
--launcher.library
plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.win32.win32.x86_1.0.200.v20090519
-product
org.eclipse.epp.package.rcp.product
--launcher.XXMaxPermSize
256M
-showsplash
-debug
org.eclipse.platform
--launcher.XXMaxPermSize
256m
-vmargs
-Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion=1.5
-Xms40m
-Xmx512m{code}
# (Note the \-debug on a line by itself)
# Start Eclipse
# Try running your test. This will now put a bunch of stuff into Eclipse's error log
view
# Open the Error Log View (window \-\- show view \-\- general \-\- Error Log)
# You'll see a number of entries with an "i" (Information) Icon in the top few rows.
Copy the contents of those rows and email them to the MXUnit google group with an
explanation of what the plugin should be doing that it's not doing

After you do that, you can remove the \-debug from your eclipse.ini file


h2. RemoteFacade

Ensure you can hit the URL in a browser. If not, there's your problem.

If you can access the URL in a browser, but the plugin still can't talk to your URL,
try opening that URL in Eclipse's internal browser

h2. Using the RemoteFacadeTester.cfm


As a last resort, open a file named "RemoteFacadeTester.cfm" in the mxunit/samples
directory. This file is included in the distribution. At the top of the file, you'll
see this content:
{code:controls=true}&lt;!--- change these as necessary ---&gt;
&lt;cfset mycomponent = "mxunit.PluginDemoTests.HodgePodgeTest"&gt;
&lt;cfset myfunction = "testNotEquals"&gt;
&lt;cfset remoteURL = "http://localhost/mxunit/framework/RemoteFacade.cfc?wsdl"&gt;{code}
Replace the variables with the component, function, and URL you're trying to invoke.
Run that RemoteFacadeTester.cfm in your browser and inspect the output. Look at the
CFDumps. It'll show you the result of running the test when run directly, when run
through a testsuite, and when run through the RemoteFacade.cfc URL. All 3 results
should be roughly the same.
