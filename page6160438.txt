Amazon EC2 Security Groups

6193204
Security Groups provide for both IP and Group Name access control. 

Using Group Names were useful for me when configuring a Linux-based MongoDB server
which the CF servers connected to. 10Gen suggests to run Mongo in "trusted" mode behind
the firewall. The problem is that if you run in trusted mode, then any server on EC2
could connect to your Mongo instance... obviously this won't do.

To properly secure Mongo on that server, then, was simply a matter of adding my CF
security group as a new "Allowed Connection" into the security group I created for
the Linux Mongo server. This way, any new CF instances I launch -- which all belong
to the CF Security Group -- will automatically be able to access the Mongo Server,
while keeping all other connections out.
