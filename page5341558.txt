Don't let the title fool you. This is far from an introduction and addresses many
areas of software testing. Specifically, it presents 36 _coverge criteria_ used in
both manual and automated testing. This text represents many years of research in
the area and is a great formal and practical overview of the numerous challenges associated
with  testing software. Note that the authors do not take *any* of the book's royalties;
instead, the royalties are used in a scholarship fund for software engineering students.
If for no other reason, that may be a good motivation to buy the book!
