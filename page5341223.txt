Formerly known as MightyMock, MXUnit offier a built-in, simple, lightweight framework
for mocking component interactions. It provides you the ability to easily and quickly
define behaviors for dependencies, including both mocking and stubbing. When mocking,
selective verification is possible, and when stubbing you can define return data or
throw exceptions.

One slick feature is the ability to match invocations by argument pattern. This gives
you the flexibility to specify either literal arguments or patterns in your mock.
More on this in the next section.
