Running directories of tests

h2. Running entire directories of Tests with one line of code

When you have a multiple tests  all residing in a directory and subdirectories,  
it's very conventient to run everything contained in those directories.  In   this
context, a directory of tests _implies_ a test suite, and MXUnit enables   you to
run directories as test suites.

Running directories of tests can be done with a single line of code:

{code}
&lt;cfinvoke component="mxunit.runner.DirectoryTestSuite"
	      method="run"
	      directory="#expandPath('/mxunit/PluginDemoTests')#"
	      recurse="true"
	      excludes="InvalidMarkupTest,FiveSecondTest"
	      returnvariable="results" /&gt;
{code}

*Explanation:*


* component: The MXUnit runner component responsible for running all the tests.
* method: The component's method being invoked.
* directory: A physical path to the directory containing your tests.
* recurse: A flag to indicate whether or not to run tests in all subdirectories.
* excludes: A list of component names to exclude.
* returnvariable: The variable name of the TestResult object returned
* componentPath: (Not listed above) Optional parameter that increases performance.
This is the component name prefix; e.g., com.foo.bar.        If not specified, MXUnit
will locate the full component name using the ColdFusion server       cache of components.
* This will pick up any file that *starts or ends with the word "Test"*, but excluding
anything in your "excludes" attribute

Once this is exectuted you can easily output the results to the screen:

{code}
&lt;cfinvoke component="mxunit.runner.DirectoryTestSuite"
	      method="run"
	      directory="#expandPath('/mxunit/PluginDemoTests')#"
	      recurse="true"
	      excludes="InvalidMarkupTest,FiveSecondTest"
	      returnvariable="results" /&gt;

&lt;cfoutput&gt; #results.getResultsOutput('extjs')# &lt;/cfoutput&gt;
{code}


Copy the above to a file called /mxunit/doc/tutorial/directoryRunner.cfm and   run
it: [http://localhost:8500/mxunit/doc/tutorial/directoryRunner.cfm|http://localhost:8500/mxunit/doc/tutorial/directoryRunner.cfm]
You should see this: !dir-runner-1.png|width=32,height=32!
