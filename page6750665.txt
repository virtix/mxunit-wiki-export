{tip}
h2. Eclipse Plugin \-\- 1.4.1

* Added "Run MXUnit Tests" to the "Run As" menu. Default keybinding is alt-shift-x,
m (you can change that in preferences)
* Added support for opening files from the "Tag Context" panel when those files are
not in projects, i.e. opens from the file system.
* Thanks Denny for these contributions\!

h2. Framework \-\- 2.0.3


h3. Enhancements

* User-contributed "assertEqualsWithTolerance()" function which adds a tolerance parameter
to equality assertions
* Updated samples/build.xml with hints for using with Jenkins
* Updated mxunit-ant.jar to log the entire html response to the console if the test
run bombs (i.e. 500 error)

h2. Framework \-\- 2.0.2


h3. Enhancements

* added restoreMethod() for undoing method overwrites from injectMethod(). This is
particularly useful when using ColdSpring-managed objects in your tests. Inspired
by [this post|http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/index.cfm/2009/7/14/Using-MXUnits-injectMethod-to-Reverse-an-injectMethod-call#c82B9BFA8-0DE7-8E6D-2C4C1BC85072A908]&amp;nbsp;
* HTML Result tweaks... mostly code cleanup. Also, no need to specify a result type
any longer as it defaults to the new HTML output introduced in MXUnit 2.0

h3. Bug Fixes

* User-supplied patch to JUnitXMLTestResult to properly encode "special characters".
Thanks\!




h2. Framework \-\- 2.0.1


h3. Enhancements


* [debug()|default:View Debug Output] and [request.debug()|default:Using request.debug()]
now support all attributes of cfdump. For example, you can now do: debug(var=mystruct,
top=5, label="some label"); This is particularly important when debugging ORM objects
* Assertion isTypeOf() now considers interfaces

h3. Bug Fixes

* Core features should now be CF7 compatible.
* MightyMock behavioral inconsistency on CF8 fixed
* Components with output=true have been turned to output=false where appropriate.
This important fix [addresses a memory condition|default:How cfcomponent output=true
can affect memory consumption] in MightyMock on Adobe ColdFusion

h3. Backwards Compatibility

* debug() will be backwards compatible IF for calls not using named arguments
* debug() will now fail if the old (removed) "debugdata" argument was passed like
so: debug(debugdata=someStruct); to fix, either change debugdata to "var" or remove
the named argument
