h1. Introduction

For [CFMongoDB|https://github.com/marcesher/cfmongodb] , I wanted to run all tests
on a schedule, either when a source code change was detected on github, or every day.
I didn't want to have Mongo running all the time \-\- just when the tests needed to
run. Ideally, my CI process would start Mongo, run the tests, and stop Mongo when
finished.&amp;nbsp;

Here's how I accomplished that.


h1. Installing MongoDB as a service


It was easiest for me to achieve this workflow by starting MongoDB as&amp;nbsp; a Windows
service because then I could simply use NET START and NET STOP commands rather than
spinning up Mongod.exe and killing it.

Installing mongod as a service is as simple as:

{code}
mongod --install --logpath c:\path\to\some\logfile.log

{code}

h1. How you will be able to run this service in Jenkins, but can't quite yet

Long heading, I know. In Jenkins, configuring the "Build Steps" *should* look like
this:
# Invoke Windows Batch Command \--&amp;nbsp; "NET START 'Mongo DB'"
# ANT \-\- runtests
# Invoke Windows Batch Command \-\- "NET STOP 'Mongo DB'"

However, [due to this bug|https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-1434] , stopping
the mongo service throws an error which will cause the Jenkins build to fail. And
that won't do.
