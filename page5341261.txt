Data Type Matching

5374017


As you've seen previously, you can match arguments by data type. The available types
are those that are commonly available in ColdFusion:
{code}
\{string\}, \{any\}, \{object\}, \{struct\}, \{udf\}, \{numeric\}, \{array\}, \{query\},
\{xml\}, \{boolean\}, \{binary\}, \{image\}
{code}

Using type argument matching, you can specify mock behavior like so:

{code}
&lt;cfset myMock.doSomething('\{struct\}','\{image\}').returns(true) /&gt;
{code}

When the mock is invoked, the value true will be returned to the calling component
only when an invocation matches this patter ... doSomething with any structure as
the first parameter followed by any image as the second parameter.

Make sure to check out the next section on Wildcard Pattern Matching!
