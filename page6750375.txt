h1. Why ANT?


You won't get far using Jenkins and ColdFusion without ANT. ANT is the Hub. It's the
glue.

Your ANT build will run your MXUnit Tests. Jenkins will run your ANT build, record
the results of the tests, and perform post-build actions (notifications, etc) based
on the results of those tests.

h1. Assumptions

We assume you have some tests and can successfully run them via either the Eclipse
plugin or your web browser

We assume that if you are not familiar with ANT that you're willing to learn enough
of it to get your CI environment set up. If you're not up for that, perhaps [simpler
automation is for you|default:Simple Test Scheduling].


h1. A thorough treatment

Bill's [original walkthrough|default:Using the Ant Task to Generate JUnit Reports]
is very thorough. In addition, please see Bill's fantastic [8-minute video|default:Screencast
- Using MXUnit and Ant for Build,Test, and Integration Automation - 8 min.] showing
exactly how to run your MXUnit tests with ANT
