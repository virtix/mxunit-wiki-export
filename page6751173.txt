h1. Creating an AWS Account


To get started with EC2, you'll need an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. Don't worry...
you can play around for a while without spending much money at all. Get out a credit
card b/c you'll need it, but as you're configuring your first instances and doing
some testing, you'll be paying pennies.

*First, go here:* [http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/|http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/*]

You will go through an account signup. If you are prompted to download any files,
do it. Save them somewhere you won't forget them. Do not publish them on your blog.
Do not put them in your public Dropbox share. Keep them secret. Keep them safe. I
keep all AWS-related files in my private DropBox so that I can access them on multiple
machines.

{note}You will not be charged anything until you create instances and run them. There
is no charge for creating an account{note}
