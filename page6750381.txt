h1. Why ANT?


You won't get far using Jenkins and ColdFusion without ANT. ANT is the Hub. It's the
glue.

Your ANT build will run your MXUnit Tests. Jenkins will run your ANT build, record
the results of the tests, and perform post-build actions (notifications, etc) based
on the results of those tests.

h1. Assumptions

We assume you have some tests and can successfully run them via either the Eclipse
plugin or your web browser

We assume that if you are not familiar with ANT that you're willing to learn enough
of it to get your CI environment set up. If you're not up for that, perhaps [simpler
automation is for you|default:Simple Test Scheduling].


h1. A thorough description of running your tests with ANT


Bill's [original walkthrough|default:Using the Ant Task to Generate JUnit Reports]
is very thorough. In addition, please see Bill's fantastic [8-minute video|default:Screencast
- Using MXUnit and Ant for Build,Test, and Integration Automation - 8 min.] showing
exactly how to run your MXUnit tests with ANT.

If you are new to ANT, I&amp;nbsp; implore you to visit those links, especially if you're
the type who doesn't like flailing about trying to make sense of foreign things.

Even if you simply read Bill's instructions, and watch the video, you'll gain enough
familiarity with ANT and MXUnit to move on ot the next step

...Or, if you're the type who likes to jump right in

h2. Directory Structure


Your final directory structure will look something like the following. If your tests
live somewhere else inside your app, that's OK... just make sure to adjust the paths
in the build file to account for their location.

In the example below, files demoted with an asterisk \(*) are files that do not yet
exist but which will when we're finished

{code}/App
*build.xml
/lib
*mxunit-ant.jar
other-whatever.jar
/tests
*HttpAntRunner.cfc
/testdir1
SomeTest.cfc
/testdir2
SomeOtherTest.cfc
{code}
h2. Copy files from MXUnit to your app

You need the following three files to start:
# mxunit-ant.jar \-\- ANT will use this to communicate with ColdFusion
# HttpAntRunner.cfc \-\- This is the "endpoint"... ANT will make HTTP requests to
this CFC, and that CFC will in turn run the MXUnit framework code which runs your
tests
# build.xml \-\- This is your new ANT build file{*}What to put where*\# Create a directory
in your app called "lib"
# Copy mxunit/ant/lib/mxunit-ant.jar into that lib directory
# Copy mxunit/samples/build.xml into your app's root, such that you end up with /app/build.xml
# Copy mxunit/samples/HttpAntRunner.cfc into your app's test root, such that you end
up with /app/tests/HttpAntRunner.cfcOpen up that HttpAntRunner.cfc after you copy
it. Notice that it simply extends the framework version. While you *could* point directly
to the framework version, you almost always want to point to your custom version,
especially if you're using ORM, testing framework controllers, or otherwise need access
to your app's Application scope

h2. Modify build.xml

The sample build.xml file which you copied is meant to be a good-enough skeleton to
get you running your tests from ANT. It also contains example "svn update" and "dist"
targets for updating a directory from SVN and creating a zip file, respectively. More
on those later.

For now, we need to run tests. To do this, you'll modify several of the properties
in the ANT file to point to the correct names and locations for your project

If you're using Eclipse or another IDE which shows the structure of an ANT file, open
the ANT view and drag your build file into it. It'll look something like this:



Change the project name to your project
